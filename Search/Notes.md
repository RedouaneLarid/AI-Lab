You might be wondering why I declared the action methods as static methods in the Checkpoint class.

That's a very good question.

To be honest, I have no clue why I did that :3

# deapth_for_search.py :

the example executed in the script uses the deapth for search algorithm to solve the maze , but you can switch to breadth for search algorithm simply by changing `frontier = StackFrontier()` to `frontier = QueueFrontier()` , since the behaviour depends on the data structure used for the frontier.
